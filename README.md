# Web Chat Room

## visit http://www.chat-app.tk for a simple demo 
###(Preferrably on Google Chrome)

This is a simple web chatroom that sits on a Java based server. 

It utilizes websockets to transmits messages between the client and the server. 

Currently, it does not require any sort of authentication

#More to come (not sure when though)
OAuth2 support

Web RTC (to possibly support live screensharing/ live video chat)
